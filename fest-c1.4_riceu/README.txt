COMPONENTS
I. Source code for EPIC spin-up and application models (festc_epic folder)
   1. Application model:
EPIC0509app_1.4_20210711.for 
            EPCM0509_app.for
   2. Spin-up model:
EPIC0509su_1.4_20210711.for 
EPCM0509_su.for
II.        Source code for post-processing tools:  
1. EPIC Yealy Extraction tool (Spatial-Allocator folder)
extractEPICYearlyAverage2CMAQriceu.cpp
extractEPIC2CMAQriceu.cpp
Same as EPIC Yearly Extraction tools but with updates in adding new N variables.
!!! Caution: The HONO, NO, and NOx emissions generated by the above extraction tools do not consider the canopy reduction effects. A separate tool (in session III) calculates the N emissions with canopy reduction effects.
III.         Tools for calculating canopy reduction factors and daily crop-weighted N variables  
1. CANOPY_REDUCTION_FACTOR
After running the EPIC APPLICATION program, users should use the CANOPY REDUCTION PROGRAM to calculate the daily canopy reduction factor. This program is adapted from Soil N codes by Quazi Rasool.
2. NVARS 
Next, users should use the NVARS program to calculate the daily crop-weighted reactive nitrogen emissions considering canopy reduction effects.


USAGE: 
Step I.         FEST-Cv1.4 RICEU REVISED VERSION 
1. Compile spin-up and application source files into executable programs 
2. To active RICEU N mechanisms, modify the EPICCONT.DAT files to change the IDN to 2.
Step II. Spatial-Allocator
1. Compile the extraction source files into executable programs 
2. Generate annual and daily outputs
Step III. Canopy reduction and NVARS tools
1. Run canopy reduction program to generate daily averaged canopy reduction factor 
2. Run NVARS tools to generate daily Nvars considering canopy reduction effects. This program also calculates and extracts other N cycling-related variables, including:
AVOL: kgN; NH3 emissions
NINX: kgN; nitrification NOx emissions
NINO: kgN; nitrification NO emissions
HONO: kgN; HONO emissions
NIN2: kgN; nitrification N2O emissions
DENO: kgN; denitrification NO emissions
DEN2: kgN; denitrification N2O emissions
FNH3: kgN; N-Ammonia fertilizer
FNO: kgN; N-Organic fertilizer
FNO3: kgN; N-nitrate fertilizer
