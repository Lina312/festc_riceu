# FEST-C V1.4 RICEU 
# VERSION: 20220701
# BASE MODEL: FEST-C V1.4 EPIC (APP & SU)
# MODIFICATIONS: 
(1) HONO & NO & N2O EMISSIONS FROM NITRIFICATION; NO EMISSIONS FROM DENITRIFICATION;
(2) FIXED HUSC & AUTO P BUGS (ONLY IN THE APPLICATION PROGRAM)
(3) DO NOT PRINT SOME OUTFILES DEFINED BY FEST-C: KWTNA; KWNCM; KWTNS; KWNCS
# USAGE: 
IDN == 2 FOR RICEU DENITRIFICATION SUBPROGRAM 
To activate RICEU modified N schemes, IDN should be 2 in the EPICCONT.DAT file.
# NEW N VARS IN DAILY & ANNUAL OUTPUTS:
(1)NINX: emissions of NO and HONO from the nitrification process (without considering canopy reduction)
(2)NINO: NO emissions from the nitrification process (without considering canopy reduction)
(3)NIN2: N2O emissions from nitrification process
(4)HONO: HONO emissions
(5)DENO: NO emissions from the denitrification process
(6)DEN2: N2O emissions from denitrification process
(7)TONO: Total NO emissions
(8)TON2: Total N2O emissions
(9)TONX: Total NO & HONO emissions 
ALL OF THE ABOVE N VARS WERE INCLUDED IN MONTHLY OUTPUTS, BUT THIS VERSION DOES NOT PRINT MONTHLY RESULTS.  

# VERSION: 20230815
# BASE MODEL (FEST-C V1.4 RICEU 20220701)
# MODIFICATIONS:
(1) BIOCHAR ALGORITHMS
(2) NITRIFICATION INHIBITOR (NI) ALGORITHMS
# USAGE:
FOR BIOCHAR MODULE ACTIVATION:
A. ADD BIOCHAR INTO FERT.DAT FILE, WHICH SHOULD DESCRIBE THE PROPERTIES (CEC, PH, BULK DENSITY, ORGANIC CARBON FRACTION OF BIOCHAR 
B. ADD BIOCHAR APPLICATION ACTIVITY INTO MANAGEMENT FILES (.OPC FILES) USING THE REVISED BIOCHAR MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OR ADD BIOCHAR APPLICATION INTO OPC FILES USING ANY OTHER PROGRAM AT SPECIFIED DATE, RATE, TILLAGE DEPTH SUCH AS PYTHON OR R SCRIPTS
   Note: SEE manageCreate folder for BIOCHAR MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
C. IBCH == 0 TURNS OFF BIOCHAR
        == 1 TURNS ON BIOCHAR
IBCH CURRENTLY DOES NOT CONTROL THE ACTIVATION (ON) OR DEACTIVATION (OFF) OF BIOCHAR ALGORITHMS; 
HOWEVER, IT IS RECOMMENDED TO SET IT TO "1". THIS WILL INDICATE IN THE OUTPUT FILE THAT BIOCHAR IS ACTIVE.
FOR NI MODULE ACTIVATION:
A.RICEU NITRIFICATION INHIBITORS MECHANISM
 38  NISOP  = 0 TURNS OFF NITRIFICATION INHIBITORS
            = 1 TURNS ON NITRIFICATION INHIBITORS-RAM MECH
            = 2 TURNS ON NITRIFICATION INHIBITORS-CONSTANT MECH
            = 3 TURNS ON NITRIFICATION INHIBITORS-SIMPLE DECAY MECH
            = 4 TURNS ON NITRIFICATION INHIBITORS-TEMPERATURE DECAY MECH
            = 5 TURNS ON NITRIFICATION INHIBITORS-DNDC-LI MECH   
To activate NI algorithms, NISOP should be 1,2,3,4 or 5 in the EPICCONT.DAT (NO.38) file. 
Currently, based on the model performance evaluation, the first NI algorithm (NISOP=1) outperforms all other available choices.
B. In this version, all agricultural areas are treated with fertilizers containing nitrification inhibitors.
